            <h6>Problem</h6>
            <p>
              A big company with more than 1200 employees initially made
              everyone work from home because of COVID-19. But now, as things
              are getting better, they're thinking about how to let some
              employees return to the office, but not all of them.
            </p>
            <p>But there are problems to solve:</p>
            <p>
              - How can they verify that employees intending to return to the
              office are healthy and not carrying the virus?
            </p>
            <p>
              - How can they efficiently manage employees who want to work
              from the office?
            </p>
            <p>
              - What steps should they take to ensure social distancing in the
              office?
            </p>
            <p>
              - What's the most effective way to implement COVID-19 safety
              measures?

          <h6 id="ke-head">Key takeaways</h6>
          <div id="in-sec">
            <p>
              1. I've come to realize that thorough research plays a crucial role in the success of any project, helping
              us
              understand the problem and its context more deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. When designing a system, it's become apparent that various challenges may arise along the way. To
              ensure a smooth project execution, it's essential to address these issues promptly, as any mistakes can
              have real-life consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. During the ideation phase, I encountered moments of creative blockage. However, I've embraced the idea
              that perseverance is key. Even when faced with hurdles, I continued sketching and brainstorming potential
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. One valuable lesson I've learned is the significance of dedicating more time to refining the design
              screens and seeking feedback from friends and fellow designers. This iterative process results in screens
              that are not only visually pleasing but also easy for users to comprehend.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. This project has provided a unique perspective on problem-solving. Unlike projects with clear financial
              objectives, the primary goal here is to address and resolve challenges in the most cost-effective manner,
              emphasizing the importance of efficiency and effective solutions over profit generation.
