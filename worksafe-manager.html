                1. I've come to realize that thorough research plays a crucial role in the success of any project,
                helping
                us
                understand the problem and its context more deeply.
              </p>
              <p class="key-takeaways-section-copy">
                2. When designing a system, it's become apparent that various challenges may arise along the way. To
                ensure a smooth project execution, it's essential to address these issues promptly, as any mistakes can
                have real-life consequences.
              </p>
              <p class="key-takeaways-section-copy">
                3. During the ideation phase, I encountered moments of creative blockage. However, I've embraced the
                idea
                that perseverance is key. Even when faced with hurdles, I continued sketching and brainstorming
                potential
                solutions.
              </p>
              <p class="key-takeaways-section-copy">
                4. One valuable lesson I've learned is the significance of dedicating more time to refining the design
                screens and seeking feedback from friends and fellow designers. This iterative process results in
                screens
                that are not only visually pleasing but also easy for users to comprehend.
              </p>
              <p class="key-takeaways-section-copy">
                5. This project has provided a unique perspective on problem-solving. Unlike projects with clear
                financial
                objectives, the primary goal here is to address and resolve challenges in the most cost-effective
                manner,
                emphasizing the importance of efficiency and effective solutions over profit generation.
