      <div class="myself">
        <p>
          I'm Raj, and I'm a 21 year old from New Delhi, India. My journey
          into the design world started in a rather unexpected way. Before all
          of this, I was really into cricket. But one day, a friend mentioned
          that they were planning to learn graphic design, and I was
          intrigued. I had no idea what graphic design was at the time, so I
          asked, "What's that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          That simple question set me on a new path. I began exploring graphic
          design, and I quickly discovered the fascinating world of UX
          design. These are all about making things not only look good but
          also work smoothly for people. It reminded me of those moments when
          I eagerly awaited Android updates, marveling at their cool
          interfaces. Back then, I didn't even know UX design was a thing,
          but that childhood curiosity stuck with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my goal is crystal clear. I want to become a skilled designer,
          focused on making life easier for people by solving everyday
          problems through clever design. I aspire to create products that are
          easy for anyone to use. Every day is a chance for me to learn and
          improve as I work towards making the world a more user-friendly
          place.

        <h6>üèè Somebody who loves cricket.</h6>
        <p>
          I absolutely love cricket! It's more than just a game, it's a big
          part of my life. Whether I'm watching a match or playing with
          friends, the excitement of cricket never gets old. Those thrilling
          moments on the field, the camaraderie, and the excitement during big
          tournaments like the World Cup, they all make cricket something
          truly special for me. It's not just a sport, it's a way of life, and
          I enjoy every bit of it.

        <h6>üîä Enthusiast of hip-hop and rap music.</h6>
        <p>
          I'm a big fan of hip-hop and rap music. It's the beats and the
          lyrics that really get me hooked. My all-time favorite artist is
          Drake because his songs connect with me on a personal level. I'm not
          just into the mainstream stuff, I love digging into the underground
          hip-hop scene too. It's a way of expressing myself and connecting
          with the world around me. It's a passion that keeps me grooving
          every day.
